"""
    servedocs_callback!(args...)

Custom callback used in [`servedocs`](@ref) triggered when a file is modified.

If the file is `docs/make.jl`, the callback will check whether any new files
have subsequently been generated in the `docs/src` folder and add them to the
watched files, it will also remove any file that may have been deleted or
renamed.

If the file is either in `docs/src`, a pass of Documenter is triggered to
regenerate the documentation, subsequently the LiveServer will render the
pages produced in `docs/build`.

## Arguments

See the docs of the parent function `servedocs`.

"""
    servedocs(; kwargs...)

Can be used when developing a package to run the `docs/make.jl` file from
Documenter.jl and then serve the `docs/build` folder with LiveServer.jl.
This function assumes you are in the directory `[MyPackage].jl` with a
subfolder `docs`.

## Keyword Arguments

* `verbose=false`: boolean switch to make the server print information about
                   file changes and connections.
* `doc_env=false`: a boolean switch to make the server start by activating the
doc environment or not (i.e. the `Project.toml` in `docs/`).
* `literate=nothing`: see `literate_dir`.
* `literate_dir=nothing`: Path to a directory containing Literate scripts if
                          these are not simply under `docs/src`. 
                          See also the docs for information about how to
                          work with Literate.
* `skip_dir=""`: a path starting with `docs/` where modifications should not
                 trigger the generation of the docs, this is useful for instance
                 if you're using Weave and Weave generates some files in
                 `docs/src/examples` in which case you should set
                 `skip_dir=joinpath("docs","src","examples")`.
* `skip_dirs=[]`: same as `skip_dir` but for a list of such dirs. Takes
                  precedence over `skip_dir`.
* `skip_files=[]`: a vector of files that should not trigger regeneration.
* `include_dirs=[]`: extra source directories to watch
                     (in addition to `joinpath(foldername, "src")`).
* `include_files=[]`: extra source files to watch. Takes precedence over
                      `skip_dirs` so can e.g. be used to track individual
                      files in an otherwise skipped directory.
* `foldername="docs"`: specify a different path for the content.
* `buildfoldername="build"`: specify a different path for the build.
* `makejl="make.jl"`: path of the script generating the documentation relative
                      to `foldername`.
* `host="127.0.0.1"`: where the server will start.
* `port=8000`: port number, an integer between 8000 (default) and 9000.
* `launch_browser=false`: specifies whether to launch a browser at the
                          localhost URL or not.
